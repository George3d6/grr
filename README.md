 Note: Project from like 2 years ago I found on a dusty hard-drive, I'm moving it here as I'm migrating sutff on my 
github account... probably never going to work on it but who know, maybe I'm bored someday and glad to have it here 
¯\_(ツ)_/¯

 ***A simple file manager in the style of ranger, written in go***

 Still in a pre release stage, only tested on arch&tumbleweed 
 Has problems with rendering on very large and extremly small terminals

 ***Roadmap****

 -> Make the whole thing less blury on re-rende (change library ?)
 -> Modularize code
 -> Ask self if this even needs to exist or if it should just be kept in the experiment stage ?
