 ***A simple file manager in the style of ranger, written in go***

 Still in a pre release stage, only tested on arch&tumbleweed 
 Has problems with rendering on very large and extremly small terminals

 ***Roadmap****

 -> Make the whole thing less blury on re-rende (change library ?)
 -> Modularize code
 -> Ask self if this even needs to exist or if it should just be kept in the experiment stage ?
